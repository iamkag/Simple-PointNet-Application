## About

PointNet is a deep learning architecture specifically designed to handle unordered point cloud data, making it a popular choice for 3D object recognition and segmentation tasks. This project provides a simplified implementation of PointNet, demonstrating its core functionalities and enabling experimentation with 3D data.

## Features

- Implementation of the core PointNet architecture
- Supports classification and segmentation tasks on 3D point clouds
- Configurable parameters for network depth, batch size, and learning rate
- Example dataset for testing and training

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkag/Simple-PointNet-Application.git
   cd Simple-PointNet-Application
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the data:**

   PointNet requires 3D point cloud data. You can use the provided example dataset or download additional data, such as the [ModelNet](https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/) or [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/) datasets. Ensure the data is formatted as `.ply` or `.obj` files or converted to suitable point cloud format for processing.

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the PointNet model, run the following command with adjustable parameters:

```bash
python train.py --epochs <number_of_epochs> --batch_size <batch_size> --learning_rate <learning_rate>
```

### Testing the Model

To test a pre-trained model, use:

```bash
python test.py --model_path <path_to_model> --data_path <path_to_test_data>
```

### Customizing Parameters

Parameters such as the number of points per cloud, learning rate, and batch size can be modified in the configuration file or by using command-line arguments.

## Examples

Here are some examples of PointNet outputs:

- **3D Classification:** Assigns labels to 3D objects based on shape.
- **Part Segmentation:** Identifies parts of an object (e.g., the body or wings of an airplane).

Screenshots and visualizations can be found in the `examples` directory.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries:

- `numpy`: For handling matrix operations and data manipulation
- `torch` and `torchvision`: For implementing and training the neural network
- `matplotlib` or `Open3D`: For visualizing 3D point clouds
- Additional dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`
